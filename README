Setup:

1. Install Python 3.6
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run development server (should reload on code changes):
```
export FLASK_APP=server.py
flask run
```

Run production server (uses an event loop to handle multiple clients simultaneously):
```
python server.py
```

Customize game:
1. Make a file called `custom_game_definition.py`.
2. Override any setting in `game_definition.py` but putting it in `custom_game_definition.py`

Run the tests:
```
python test.py
```
